# Quarantine React Web Chat App
Our Quaranchill website is a way to reconnect with other people. Quaranchill is a fully fledged world chat system with added icons to allow better communication between users. The home page displays a basic user creation where one is allowed to pick a user icon and designate a name. We used Socket.IO, a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. We used React Bootstrap and SASS for UI, and Cypress to test the app.
